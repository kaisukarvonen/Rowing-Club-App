# Rowing Club App
This Android app is developed to simplify the routine tasks of writing logbook entries and distance-statistics in a rowing club. The app offers lists of the club members and of the boats. They can be assigned to a trip which can be recorded using the GPS of the smartphone. The trips are saved in the logbook and getting synchronized between the club membersâ€™ app-installations. The users are also able to see some statistics like their overall-kilometers and a ranking who in the club has the most kilometers.

## Installation
The Android App can be installed very simple like every other Android app which is not listed in the PlayStore. The user has to download the apk-File or it gets over USB on his device. Then the installation can be started by clicking on the apk-File in a file browser or in the download folder "App". Maybe its neseccary to turn on "install Apps from unknown sources" in the Android settings, if it is not activeated yet. The Android system will ask the user for that if its not activated yet.
For syncronizing the data a Server with PHP and MySQL is necesarry. The PHP files have to be moved to the server and a new database needs to be created. In the database some tables must be generated, according to the model which is availible as png in the "Database" Folder in the Git ressource. Finally the server path and database name needs to be updated in the Fuse project (MainView.ux).
